diceGame
The game is played between two players on the same board.
Each player roll the dice once and gets points.
If the players point is not up to 6, the player is not qualified to get 6 point.
Each player click on the HOLD button to grab the winning score to the global score.
The input beside the board can be manipulated to set a winning score.
If any of the player's point is up to the winning score, that player is set to be the winner for that game.
The winner is announced after the end of the game.
